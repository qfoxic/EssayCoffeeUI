			  <h4 class="panel-title">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#question-3">
				  How can I pay for the custom written paper?<br> Is it safe to submit payments through your site?
				</a>
			  </h4>
			</div>
			<div id="question-3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			  <div class="panel-body">
				<p>EssayCoffee.com cooperates with two companies 2Checkout and Moneybookers to ensure safety and  speed of your money transfer as those companies are world known for the quality of their service.

			  <h4 class="panel-title">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#question-4">
				  Why is the price so low/high?
				</a>
			  </h4>
			</div>
			<div id="question-4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			  <div class="panel-body">
				<p>Our service fees are slightly higher than the industry average. You receive a truly attentive personal  approach from us and truly exclusive writing. You will see that this will make a difference. Never fall  into a trap of ordering from a service with the writing fees lower than $12/page on the average. Can you  imagine a professional writer, who would write a good paper for less than $9/page? (This is the maximum of  what writers can get out of $12). Most probably, your paper will be immediately resold to essay banks to cover  the difference, or the paper will be written by some cheap amateur student, and you will fail to receive a good  work. We do not resell any papers. The price that our customers pay for the service is just enough for us not to do that.</p>

				  Who will write my custom paper?

			  </h4>
			</div>
			<div id="question-6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			  <div class="panel-body">
				<h4>What are the credentials of my writer? What is my writer's degree?</h4>
				<p>Our professional writing staff consists of writers with various academic degrees, from Master's to Ph.D level writers, arranged in a number of specializations. Such arrangement allows us to individually choose a writer who fits the exact  requirements for writing a particular paper. To ensure the quality of our service, we carefully investigate each writer's skills set, based on the following parameters:</p>
				<ul class="red-bullets">
					<li>Academic and professional experience;</li>
					<li>Results of the writer's online written English test and writer's application essay;</li>
					<li>The score in a particular field of study that the writer has gained, while working for EssayCoffee.com;</li>
					<li>Writer's current availability and his willingness to complete a particular paper for our customer.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Where is my writer from?</h4>
				<p>We employ writers from all over the world, varying from English native speakers (ENL) to non-native speakers with good command of English. All of our writers demonstrate a sufficient command of English and a good understanding of other subjects, so all customers can be sure to obtain the writing quality that corresponds to their academic level, even if their paper is completed by a non-native speaker. Each customer may choose, if possible, out of:</p>
				<ul class="red-bullets">
					<li>Best available writer;</li>
					<li>Advanced (high quality);</li>
					<li>ENL (US, CA, UK, AU).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the native speaking writer is currently not available for completing a paper in any particular specialization, the paper can be completed by a non-native speaking writer, whose knowledge of English still corresponds to the highest TOEFL level mark.</p>
			  </div>
			  <h4>Can I talk to the writer who will be writing my paper?</h4>
			  <p>You will be able to communicate with the writer by sending messages from your <a href="{% url 'my-orders' %}" class="more" target="_blank">Personal order page</a>.  You should also be getting an email notification about every new message received from the writer.  Nevertheless, it is your responsibility to check your personal page directly from time to time in case  writer has any questions regarding your order.</p>
