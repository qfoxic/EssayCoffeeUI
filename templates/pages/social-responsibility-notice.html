	<section>
		<p>Dear customers and visitors to our website.</p>
		<p>As a business, we are not only responsible to our customers and writers to fulfill our main business functions, but must also adhere to established general social morals and tenets.</p>
		<p>While we cannot provide guarantees against misuse of any research material we produce, or effectively protect infringement of our writersâ€™ copyrights, we can certainly raise our service to a higher level where social responsibility and compliance with academic rules are concerned.</p>
		<p>As a first step, we have identified subjects and fields of study where misuse of research material by the customer could possibly lead to a fake or unearned degree. We have also acknowledged situations where primary human rights, life and health might directly depend on the decisions of our customers, in real-world professional situations.</p>
		<p>We believe these areas include:</p>
		<ul class="red-bullets">
			<li>Engineering</li>
			<li>Civil Engineering</li>
			<li>Criminology and Criminal Law</li>
			<li>Criminal Justice</li>
			<li>Medicine</li>
			<li>Medical Sciences (Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology etc.)</li>
			<li>Nursing</li>
			<li>Aviation</li>
			<li>Health Care</li>
			<li>Architecture, Building and Planning</li>
		</ul>
		<p>* This list will be further developed and additional disciplines might be added.</p>
		<p>To affect or ensure academic integrity in these areas on our side, if an order falls under the policy, we resign such an order and issue a full refund.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>THIS POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO SUBJECTS OTHER THAN MEDICINE and similar (as listed above).</strong></p>

		</blockquote>
